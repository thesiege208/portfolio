                                <p>
                                        During a game design course at UC Berkeley, my friend, who had no prior
                                        experience with Git, asked for a tutorial on the basic Git commands so that she
                                        could access and use our project repository. At her request, I wrote this short
                                        and informal guide for her, providing just enough context so she would
                                        understand why certain actions were required.
                                </p>

                                        In 2019, I started at Veeva Systems, Inc. as a technical writing intern and was
                                        soon promoted to Associate Technical Writer on the CRM documentation team. Two
                                        years later, I was promoted again to Technical Writer.

                                <p>As part of the CRM documentation team, my responsibilities include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>
                                                writing admin-focused release notes for my assigned areas of the Veeva

                                        I became proficient with the various tools and software we commonly use,

                                        Additionally, I played a more technical role on the team thanks to my previous
                                        coding experience and provided support in maintaining and designing our
                                        websites. In 2022, when we started Flightpath to host end user-focused training
                                        material, I took charge of developing the homepage and the feedback/review modal
                                        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
